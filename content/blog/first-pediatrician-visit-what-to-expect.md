Your baby's first pediatrician visit usually happens within 2-3 days of leaving the hospital. If you're feeling nervous, that's completely normal. Here's everything you need to know to walk in prepared and confident.

## When Is the First Visit?

Most pediatricians want to see newborns:

- **24-48 hours** after hospital discharge for vaginal births
- **48-72 hours** after discharge for C-section births
- **Sooner** if there are any concerns (jaundice, feeding issues, weight loss)

This early visit is important to check that baby is adjusting well to life outside the womb.

## What Happens at the Visit

### Weight Check

This is the main event. Babies typically:

- Lose 5-10% of birth weight in the first few days
- Return to birth weight by 10-14 days
- Gain 5-7 oz per week after that

Your pediatrician will weigh your baby naked and compare it to their birth weight.

### Physical Examination

The doctor will check:

- **Head**: Fontanelles (soft spots), shape, circumference
- **Eyes**: Checking for red reflex, signs of infection
- **Ears**: Structure and response to sound
- **Mouth**: Palate, tongue (checking for tongue-tie)
- **Heart**: Listening for murmurs
- **Lungs**: Clear breathing sounds
- **Belly**: Checking organs, umbilical cord stump
- **Hips**: Testing for hip dysplasia
- **Genitals**: Normal development, circumcision healing (if applicable)
- **Skin**: Jaundice, rashes, birthmarks
- **Reflexes**: Moro, rooting, grasp reflexes

### Feeding Assessment

Be ready to discuss:

- How often baby is eating
- How long each feeding takes
- Breastfeeding: Which breast, any latch issues
- Formula: How many ounces per feeding
- Any concerns (pain, baby seems unsatisfied)

### Diaper Discussion

Your doctor will ask about:

- Number of wet diapers per day
- Number of dirty diapers per day
- Color and consistency of poop

> **Pro tip**: Track feedings and diapers for a few days before the visit. When the doctor asks "How many wet diapers yesterday?" you'll know exactly.

## Questions to Ask Your Pediatrician

Don't be shy—write these down and bring them with you:

### Feeding Questions

- Is my baby getting enough milk?
- How do I know when baby is full?
- When should I start pumping? (if breastfeeding)
- Is it okay to give a pacifier?
- How do I know if baby has reflux?

### Sleep Questions

- Where should baby sleep?
- Is it safe for baby to sleep in a swing/car seat?
- How long can baby sleep without eating?
- When can we start a bedtime routine?

### Health Questions

- Is this [specific thing] normal?
- What should I do if baby gets a fever?
- When should I call vs. go to urgent care vs. ER?
- Do you have after-hours support?

### Practical Questions

- When is the next appointment?
- What vaccines are coming up?
- How do I schedule sick visits?
- Who should I call with questions?

## How to Prepare

### The Night Before

- [ ] Write down your questions
- [ ] Pack the diaper bag (extra diapers, wipes, change of clothes)
- [ ] Charge your phone
- [ ] Review your feeding/diaper notes
- [ ] Get baby's outfit ready (easy to remove)

### What to Bring

- **Insurance cards**
- **Hospital discharge papers**
- **List of questions**
- **Feeding/diaper log** (or your tracking app)
- **Your own water and snacks** (appointments can run long)
- **Pacifier** if baby uses one
- **Extra outfit** for baby
- **Blanket**

### Day of the Visit

- Feed baby right before leaving (a full baby is a happy baby)
- Dress baby in easy-on, easy-off clothes
- Arrive 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork
- Bring a support person if possible

## Red Flags to Mention

Always tell your pediatrician if you've noticed:

- Baby isn't waking to eat
- Fewer wet/dirty diapers than expected
- Yellow skin or eyes (jaundice)
- Fever over 100.4°F (38°C)
- Difficulty breathing
- Unusual crying or fussiness
- Feeding problems
- Anything that worries you

Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong, speak up.

## What About Your Recovery?

Good pediatricians know that a healthy mom means a healthy baby. Don't be surprised if they ask about:

- How you're feeling physically
- Your emotional state
- Signs of postpartum depression
- Your support system at home

Be honest. If you're struggling, this is a safe place to say so.

## After the Visit

### Next Appointments

Typical newborn visit schedule:

- **1 week**: Weight check, jaundice follow-up
- **2 weeks**: Weight and feeding assessment
- **1 month**: Full checkup, growth tracking
- **2 months**: Checkup + first vaccines

### Between Visits

Know how to reach your pediatrician for:

- Urgent questions
- After-hours concerns
- Prescription refills
- General questions (many have nurse lines)

## Tips From Experienced Parents

> "Don't worry if you cry at the first appointment. Hormones are wild, sleep deprivation is real, and it's emotional seeing your tiny baby being examined. The staff has seen it all." — Sarah, mom of two

> "Bring someone with you if you can. They can hold the baby while you talk to the doctor, and two sets of ears remember more than one." — Marcus, first-time dad

> "Write everything down or you WILL forget. I thought I'd remember what the doctor said about feeding, but by the time I got home, it was all a blur." — Jennifer, mom of three

## The Bottom Line

Your first pediatrician visit is really about three things:

1. **Making sure baby is healthy**
2. **Answering your questions**
3. **Building a relationship with your baby's doctor**

Come prepared, ask your questions, and remember—no question is too small or silly. You're learning, and that's exactly what these visits are for.
