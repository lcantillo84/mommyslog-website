Are you a sleep-deprived new mom trying to remember when your baby last ate? You're not alone. Keeping track of feeding times, durations, and which breast you used can feel impossible when you're running on two hours of sleep.

That's where baby feeding tracker apps come in. These digital helpers can save your sanity by doing the remembering for you. But with hundreds of options in the App Store, which one should you choose?

I tested 20+ baby tracking apps and narrowed it down to the 7 best **completely free** options (no hidden paywalls or subscriptions). Here's what I found.

## What to Look for in a Baby Feeding Tracker App

Before we dive into specific apps, here's what matters most:

### 1. Privacy First

Your baby's data is precious. Look for apps that:

- Store data locally on your device
- Don't require account creation
- Don't sell your information to advertisers
- Have a clear privacy policy

### 2. Simple Interface

You'll be using this app at 3 AM with a crying baby. It needs to be:

- One-tap logging
- Clear, large buttons
- Works with one hand
- No complicated menus

### 3. Key Features

**Must-haves:**

- Track feeding times
- Record duration
- Note which breast (for breastfeeding)
- Track bottle/formula amounts
- Simple history view
- Export data for doctor visits

## #1. Mommy's Log - Best for Privacy & Simplicity

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 4.9/5**

**Price:** 100% Free, No Ads
**Best For:** Privacy-conscious moms who want simple tracking

### What Makes It Stand Out

**Privacy-First Design:**

- All data stays on YOUR device
- No account required
- No data collection
- No ads
- No tracking

This is the only app I tested that truly respects your privacy. In an age where every app wants your data, Mommy's Log takes the opposite approach.

### Features

**Feeding Tracking:**

- Breastfeeding with side tracking
- Suggests which breast to use next (alternates automatically)
- Built-in timer for live tracking
- Quick manual entry
- Bottle feeding with amount
- Formula feeding

**Diaper Tracking:**

- Wet, dirty, or mixed
- One-tap logging
- Notes field

**Export:**

- CSV format for spreadsheets
- Text summary for sharing
- Perfect for doctor visits

### Pros

- ✓ Genuinely free forever
- ✓ No ads
- ✓ Super simple interface
- ✓ Privacy focused
- ✓ Fast and responsive
- ✓ Breast side suggestions

### Cons

- ✗ iOS only (no Android yet)
- ✗ Doesn't track sleep or growth
- ✗ No cloud sync (by design for privacy)

**Who It's For:**

- Breastfeeding moms
- Privacy-conscious parents
- Anyone who hates ads and subscriptions
- Moms who want simple, not complicated

## Common Baby Feeding Questions

### How often should I feed my newborn?

Newborns typically eat every 2-3 hours, or 8-12 times in 24 hours. But every baby is different. Signs your baby is hungry:

- Rooting (turning head, opening mouth)
- Sucking on hands
- Smacking lips
- Crying (this is a late hunger cue)

A feeding tracker helps you identify your baby's unique patterns.

### How long should feedings last?

- **Breastfeeding:** 10-45 minutes
- **Bottle feeding:** 15-30 minutes

If feedings consistently take longer or shorter, discuss with your pediatrician.

### Do I really need a feeding tracker?

While not required, most moms find trackers incredibly helpful:

- Pediatricians ask specific questions (when was last feeding? how much?)
- Helps identify patterns
- Peace of mind (did I feed from left or right?)
- Reduces mental load during exhausting newborn phase

## Tips for Successful Feeding Tracking

1. **Start from Day One:** Don't wait until you're confused. Start tracking from the hospital if possible.

2. **Keep Your Phone Handy:** Have it within arm's reach during feedings.

3. **Log Immediately:** Don't trust your memory to log it later. You'll forget.

4. **Use Notes Field:** Quick observations can be valuable: "Fussy during feeding", "Fell asleep after 10 min", "Seemed extra hungry"

5. **Review Patterns Weekly:** Look for trends - cluster feeding times, fussy periods, growth spurts

6. **Export Before Doctor Visits:** Bring your feeding history to appointments. Pediatricians love data.

## Privacy Concerns with Baby Apps

⚠️ **Important:** Many free apps make money by:

- Selling your data to advertisers
- Showing targeted ads
- Requiring paid upgrades

**Before using any app, check:**

1. Read the privacy policy
2. Look for "We don't collect data" statements
3. Check if it requires account creation
4. See if there are ads

Your baby's data (feeding times, health patterns) is sensitive. Choose apps that respect that.

## Final Verdict

After testing 20+ apps, here's my recommendation:

**For most moms:** Start with **Mommy's Log**

- ✓ Genuinely free
- ✓ Beautifully simple
- ✓ Respects your privacy
- ✓ Does feeding + diapers really well

**Bottom line:** The best app is the one you'll actually use. Start simple. You can always switch later if needed.
